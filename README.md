# DevOps Facilities 

There's a opinion:[Microservices and DevOps: Better together](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/microservices-devops-better-together), and I agree with that.

As a developer in a start-up team, I deeply believe that without DevOps one can never drive the microservices application effectively.

Sadly, most of my colleagues don't have much experience in both development and microservices, they don't get the whole picture of microservices clearly, yet the manager and leader still want to try this challenging architecture. As a result, firstly I need to set-up some basic facilities for the team, so that we can integrate our modules a little bit easier.

## The tools

Following are the tools in my toolbox to achieve the goal for now:
* Docker/Docker Compose
* OpenLDAP
* GitLab
* Jenkins
* "Workbench" project

## The process flow
